/**
 * Checks if the provided string is a valid email address.

 * This function uses a regular expression to validate the email format. It checks for a general
 * pattern that includes characters before the "@" symbol, followed by characters after it,
 * and finally a domain suffix. This is a basic validation and might not cover all edge cases
 * of email address validation according to the RFC specifications.
 *
 * @param {{ email: string }} params An object containing the email address to validate.
 * @returns {{ status: boolean, result: boolean | null }} Object containing the status of the operation
 * and the result of the email validation.
