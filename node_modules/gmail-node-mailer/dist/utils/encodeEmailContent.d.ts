/**
 * Encodes various types of content related to emails into Base64 or URL-safe Base64 formats.
 * This function is versatile, handling encoding for email subjects, MIME messages, and attachments.
 * It automatically applies URL-safe encoding for MIME messages and standard Base64 encoding for others.
 * If the content for an email subject is empty, it defaults to 'No Subject'.
 *
 * The function provides robust error handling, ensuring that any encoding issues are gracefully managed
 * and reported back to the caller through a structured response, including a success flag, the encoded content,
 * and a message describing the outcome of the operation.
 *
 * @param {IEncodeEmailContentParams} params - Parameters containing the content to encode and the type of encoding.
 *    - `content`: The actual string content to encode.
 *    - `type`: The type of content being encoded (subject, MIME message, or attachment).
 * @returns {IEncodeEmailContentResponse} - A response object containing:
 *    - `isEncoded`: A boolean indicating if the encoding was successful.
 *    - `encodedContent`: The resulting encoded string.
 *    - `message`: A description of the outcome or error message if an error occurred.
