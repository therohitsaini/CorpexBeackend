/**
 * Constructs and sends an email through the Gmail API, accommodating optional HTML content and file attachments.
 * This lower-level function is designed to be called by the `sendEmail` function, which performs initial validations
 * and setups. It dynamically constructs a MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) message, adjusting the
 * structure based on the presence of HTML content and attachments to ensure compatibility with various email client standards.
 *
 * The function supports both plain text and HTML emails, and can manage multiple attachments. It handles the encoding
 * for subjects and the email body to support a wide range of characters beyond basic ASCII, including UTF-8 characters.
 *
 * ### Function Parameters:
 * - `gmailClient` (gmail_v1.Gmail): The authenticated Gmail client instance from the Google API library. This client
 *   is used to send the email.
 * - `params` (ISendEmailParams): Object containing all necessary data for sending an email:
 *   - `senderEmail` (string): The email address of the sender.
 *   - `recipientEmail` (string): The email address of the recipient.
 *   - `subject` (string): The subject of the email. Defaults to an empty string if not provided.
 *   - `message` (string): The main content of the email, can be plain text or HTML.
 *   - `attachments` (IAttachment[]): Optional array of attachment objects, each containing a `filename`, `mimeType`,
 *     and `content` encoded in base64.
 *
 * ### Return Value:
 * Returns a Promise that resolves to an `ISendEmailFunctionResponse` object, which includes:
 * - `sent` (boolean): Indicates whether the email was successfully sent.
 * - `message` (string): A message describing the result of the send operation, useful for logging and user feedback.
 * - `gmailResponse` (any): The raw response from the Gmail API, providing detailed success or error information.
 *
 * ### Errors:
 * The function captures and handles errors internally, focusing on encoding issues or API failures. It returns a
 * structured error response in case of failure.
 *
 * ### Example Usage:
 * ```javascript
 * const emailParams = {
 *   senderEmail: 'sender@example.com',
 *   recipientEmail: 'recipient@example.com',
 *   subject: 'Test Email',
 *   message: '<h1>Hello World!</h1>',
 *   attachments: [
 *     { filename: 'test.txt', mimeType: 'text/plain', content: 'Base 64 Encoded File Content, i.e. SGVsbG8gd29ybGQh...' }
 *   ]
 * };
 *
 * const response = await sendEmailFunction(gmailClient, emailParams);
 * console.log(response.message);
 * ```
 *
 * This function is a critical component of an email sending pipeline, designed for robust and flexible email generation,
 * suitable for a variety of scenarios from simple notifications to complex newsletters with multiple attachments.
